# HorribleCodeActivity
Group Project

The group project will be split between two teams: 
Proper Practices -   Grishma and Ivan
Improper Practices - Aidan and Carter

Violated Principles

KISS is violated in the calculator functions by not keeping the code simple and repeating lines that could be condensed.
Single Responsibility is violated by the functions each doing multiple tasks, such as taking inputs, type casting the inputs, and then performing the calculation.
Documentation is violated by the lack of comments and unclear names of each function.
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is violated by grabbing user input multiple times, and repeating the prompts multiple times.
