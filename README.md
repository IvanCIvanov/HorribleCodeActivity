# HorribleCodeActivity
Group Project

The group project will be split between two teams: 
Proper Practices -   Grishma and Ivan
Improper Practices - Aidan and Carter


Proper Practice Version - describing our code and how we implemented
File: calculator_proper.py

This program is a simple calculator that the user can perform addition, subtraction
and multiplication. It uses functions for each operation and includes a loop to let users 
continue using the calculator until they choose to exit. 

Coding Principles Demonstrated 
Kiss (Keep it Simple, Stupid): The calculator has a clear structure where the logic flows
from input to output. The user interface is straightforward with clear results.

DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself): Code repetition is avoided by using functions such as user input to handle input. 
Instead of repeating the input logic the same function is reused so the code is much cleaner and readable.

Single Responsibility: Main prompts the user and displays their outcome, the rest of the project is split up.

Documentation: Every function has comments that are clear and easy to follow along to explain the purpose 
of each line of code.
